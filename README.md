# Hospital-Emergency-Room-Dashboard
📊 My first Excel MIS Dashboard project analyzing Hospital ER performance. Built using Excel tools like Pivot Tables, Sparklines, Conditional Formatting, and Charts to track patient count, wait times, referrals, etc. A hands-on project during my data analytics journey.

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is my first end-to-end Excel MIS Dashboard, built during the foundational phase of my journey into MIS and Data Analytics. The dashboard is focused on analyzing real-time Emergency Room (ER) data for a hospital and demonstrates how Excel can be a powerful tool for data-driven decision-making in the healthcare domain.

The dashboard helps healthcare administrators visualize key performance metrics, reduce service delays, and make timely operational improvements using intuitive and interactive reports.

## 🎯 Objective
The main objective of this project is to empower hospital stakeholders with real-time visibility into the performance of their Emergency Room (ER). By presenting critical metrics in a visually engaging format, the dashboard enables decision-makers to:

- Identify peak traffic periods  
- Monitor patient service times  
- Analyze patient demographics  
- Assess service quality  
- Evaluate department referrals  
- Take actionable steps toward operational efficiency

This project bridges the gap between raw ER data and strategic healthcare management.

## 🧩 Key Dashboard Features
The dashboard provides a consolidated view of essential metrics through a combination of charts, conditional formatting, and dynamic Excel features. It includes:

- 👥 **Patient Count**: Displays daily visit trends using sparklines to identify high-traffic days and patterns.  
- ⏱ **Average Wait Time**: Tracks how long patients wait before being attended to, helping to detect delays and inefficiencies.  
- 💬 **Satisfaction Score**: Captures and reflects average patient feedback scores to measure service quality.  
- 🛏 **Admission Status**: Visualizes the percentage of patients admitted vs. not admitted.  
- 📊 **Age Group Distribution**: Categorizes patients by age brackets to study demographic trends.  
- ✅ **Timeliness of Service**: Indicates the percentage of patients seen within the first 30 minutes.  
- 👫 **Gender Analysis**: Compares the number of male vs. female patients for gender-based analytics.  
- 🏥 **Department Referrals**: Highlights which departments patients are most frequently referred to (e.g., Orthopedics, General Physician, etc.).

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used
This dashboard was built entirely using Microsoft Excel, leveraging the following tools and techniques:

- **Data Cleaning & Structuring**: Removed inconsistencies, null values, and formatted raw data for analysis.  
- **Pivot Tables**: Used to aggregate and summarize key metrics dynamically.  
- **Charts**: Bar charts, pie charts, doughnut charts, and column charts for visual storytelling.  
- **Sparklines**: Inline mini-charts used for trend visualization of daily patient flow.  
- **Conditional Formatting**: Applied to highlight patterns, critical values, or deviations in data.  
- **Dynamic Formulas**: Used Excel functions like `IF()`, `AVERAGEIF()`, `COUNTIF()`, `INDEX-MATCH()`, etc., to drive automation and interactivity.

## 📈 Project Learnings
This project gave me hands-on experience in using Excel not just as a spreadsheet tool, but as a **business intelligence solution**. I learned how raw data can be transformed into actionable insights that drive real improvements in real-world environments such as healthcare.

### Key takeaways:
- Importance of clean and structured data  
- Power of visual storytelling through dashboards  
- Role of MIS tools in operational management  
- Confidence in independently building data reports from scratch

## 💡 Future Scope
While this dashboard is a strong starting point, it also opens doors to future enhancements:

- Integration with Power BI for more advanced interactive reports  
- Automated data refresh using Power Query  
- Inclusion of time-series forecasting for patient inflow  
- Connecting Excel to external data sources (CSV, Access, SQL)
